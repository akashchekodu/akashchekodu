# 👋 Hi, I'm Akash Chekodu

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at PES University, specializing in **AI/ML**, **full-stack development**, and **scalable data systems**. I love building intelligent, production-ready software—from real-time news aggregators and disaster tracking platforms to distributed systems and LLM-powered applications.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & ML Projects**  
  Built RAG-based financial assistants and seismic risk predictors using LLMs, PySpark, and time series models  

- 🔧 **Backend Systems**  
  Designed and deployed scalable pipelines with Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, and Flask  

- ⚙️ **Distributed Systems**  
  Created a RAFT-consensus key-value store in Rust with gRPC and persistent storage  

- 🌐 **Web Development**  
  Full-stack apps with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Neo4j, and AWS  

- 📈 **Always Learning**  
  Obsessed with clean systems design, low-latency pipelines, and real-world ML applications
